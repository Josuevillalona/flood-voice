# Data Access Agreement

Before accessing FloodNet data, please review our [Data Access License Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jd5Q2UYj_0PwMRplFISmhT6LswpS08D9/edit), which outlines the terms and conditions associated with the use of FloodNet data.

We also encourage you to thoroughly review this document, particularly the section regarding [noise in sensor data](#measurement-noise-and-data-processing-to-filter-non-flood-measurements) and our data processing pipeline used to clean non-flood measurements from the dataset. Due to the nature of the sensor design, it is possible for non-flood or noise measurements to appear in the dataset, and we aim to reduce misinterpretation of data as much as possible. If you have questions about the dataset, please contact [info@floodnet.nyc](mailto:info@floodnet.nyc).

# Data Summary

There are two ways to access FloodNet data:

1. Time series data through the data API   
2. Time series data in CSV file format \- CSV files are updated daily  
3. Coming soon: event based dataset, with a separate entry and summary statistics for each measured flood event

## Data API

The Floodnet Data API is available in an early-access beta version. Be advised that query fields and outputs are subject to change as we improve the API and incorporate user feedback. 

Basic usage of the API is illustrated in this public [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BMFAwzKd9Oa8yn68E93vJMPGIDe4L3Lh#scrollTo=GM5MIbANQIWK), which provides runnable python code to interact with the API. A limited collection of REST API endpoints are available for querying sensor deployment locations and their associated data. For more complex queries, a GraphQL API is also available and demonstrated in this [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1n00hQi3Li_NMj7xTCzvXOQDelbt5e0Kv).

## 

## CSV data files

The CSV data files are updated at 5AM ET daily and consist of a series of CSV files, with one CSV file for each sensor and month. 

After you fill out the data request form, you will be notified when you are granted permission to access the data. Once access is granted, [**you can access the CSV directory at this link**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q92SqBQojRlJgaETJmqGFFAWyzgrikK8?usp=drive_link).

The monthly data files are located within a folder for each sensor. The folder and filename structure use the following format:

`[slug]/[slug]+[YYYY]-[MM].csv`

Where:

* slug \= human readable ID of the sensor (followed by unique ID e.g. **`1umos0`** below)  
* YYYY \= 4 digit year, e.g., 2024  
* MM \= 2 digit month, e.g., 07

Here is an example of the CSV folder structure:

**`BK-10th-ave-76th-st-1umos0`**`/`

**`BK-10th-ave-76th-st-1umos0`**`+2024-06.csv`

**`BK-10th-ave-76th-st-1umos0`**`+2024-07.csv`

Metadata (described below) are stored in the file “deployment-info.csv” in the main CSV directory folder, where the date in the file name (i.e., 20YY-MM-DD) updates daily.

## Data fields

The CSV data exports and the API use the same field names, which are described below. Data are collected at 1 minute intervals, however, earlier versions of our sensor, operating before November 2021 were programmed to collect data at 5 minute intervals. A larger time interval may be observed if a sensor was temporarily down or if there was a data transmission failure.

### **Depth data field descriptions** 

The following data fields are used in the sensor data CSVs: **\[slug\]-\[unique\_id\]+\[YYYY\]-\[MM\].csv.** These fields also match those used in the API.

| Name | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **time** | The ISO-8601 date-time format in **UTC**. e.g. **2023-02-22T14:20:30.000Z** |
| **depth\_proc\_mm** | **This is the recommended depth field to use.** Time-series depth data in units of millimeters (mm) that have been processed using a series of custom heuristic filters designed to remove non-flood measurements. These processing stages are in addition to the filters applied to the **depth\_filt\_mm** dataset described below. Details of the processing and filtering pipeline are provided below. |
| **depth\_filt\_mm** | Time-series depth data in mm that have been filtered such that values below 10 mm are set to zero to remove low-level measurement noise. The remainder of the data are not filtered, therefore noise and non-flood events removed from **depth\_proc\_mm** remain in this dataset. If needed, these data can be used to verify that depth\_proc\_mm did not accidentally filter out data from a flood event. Details of the processing and filtering pipeline are provided below. |
| **depth\_raw\_mm** | Time-series of raw depth measurements in mm, which have not been subjected to any filtering or processing steps focussed on removing noise. The calculation of depth from dist\_mm is described below. These data can be used if custom filtering processes are to be used. |

# How do the sensors capture data?

The FloodNet sensors use an ultrasonic sensor to **measure distance** to the horizontal surface below the sensor at a regular interval, currently **once every 60 seconds**. Some sensors operating before November 2021 were programmed to measure distance once every 5 minutes, therefore some data before November 2021 may be presented with a time interval \> 1 minute. 

The sensors work using ultrasound: they emit ultrasonic sound waves at a frequency outside the range of human hearing and then record the time it takes for the wave to bounce back off the closest reflective surface and return to the sensor.  The sensor then uses the travel time of the ultrasonic pulse to calculate the distance to that reflective surface (*z*), whether it is the ground or water surface.

Sometimes the sensor will send out a ping, but will never receive an echo back. In these cases, the measurement is invalid and we record a null value. **If you see a missing time point in the time series, this is a potential cause**.

The distance between the sensor and the surface below is calculated using Equation 1,  where z is the distance to the ground, v is the speed of sound, and ∆t/2 is the time that it takes for the sound to bounce back and return to the sensor (divided by two because it's traveling twice the distance we're measuring). The sensor has an internal temperature sensor and corrects v for the air temperature, given the temperature-dependence of the speed of sound.

z=v∆t2				Eq. 1

To calculate flood depth, the measured distance between the sensor and the ground below must be known under non-flooded conditions. This value is calculated through a dynamic calibration procedure that occurs at 5 AM daily, in which the distance measurements (*z*) collected over the previous three nights (between 10 PM and 5 AM) are analyzed to determine the median value (*z*night\~median). If the standard deviation of the night-time distance measurements exceeds 5 mm (signifying either a flood or erroneous high variance), the previous day's *z*night\~median calculation is used. To calculate flood depth *D*t at time point *t*, the sensor's distance measurement at that time (zt) is subtracted from *z*night\~median (Equation 2). The resulting dataset is designated **depth\_raw\_mm.**

*D*t \=  *z*night\~median \- *z*t 			Eq. 2

This dynamic calibration approach allows data collection to adapt to potential changes in sensor height or seasonal variation in baseline *z*night\~median readings.

# Measurement Noise and Data Processing to Filter Non-Flood Measurements {#measurement-noise-and-data-processing-to-filter-non-flood-measurements}

​​A tradeoff of the easily deployable and inexpensive nature of the sensors is that they might detect signals from normal activity of city streets that are not associated with floods, such as objects temporarily placed underneath a sensor. These readings include single point measurements (i.e., “blips”; e.g., a person, vehicle, or object located underneath the sensor at the moment a sensor reading is collected), sequences of sensor readings at the same height for a period of time (i.e., “boxes”; e.g., objects, such as a parked car or garbage, placed underneath the sensor and not moved for a period of time), or more complex series of anomalous readings:

**Blips:** a momentary jump in depth, where the measured depth returns to the previous value a sample or two later. This is often caused by someone or something passing under the sensor while it is taking its measurement (x-axis \= time & y-axis \= depth in meters).

![][image1]

**Boxes:** a sudden and persistent jump in depth. This is commonly caused by something placed beneath the sensor, such as garbage, bicycles, or other objects (x-axis \= time & y-axis \= depth in meters).![][image2]

**Complex Noise:** a chaotic chain of pulse/box-like noise that can occur for an extended period of time. This can be caused by aberrant reflections on uneven, sloped, or complex surfaces such as vegetation or parts of a bicycle (x-axis \= time & y-axis \= depth in meters).

![][image3]

After converting distance measurements to depths, the sensor data are processed through a series of filter stages to filter out non-flood measurements. In the following, a measured ‘event’ is defined as a series of one or more depth readings greater than 10 mm. A brief description is below, more detailed information can be found at [https://doi.org/10.1029/2023WR036806](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023WR036806).  	

The first filter stage is designed to filter low-level measurement noise within our acceptable range of error. To do so, all reported depths less than 10 mm are assigned a value of zero. The resulting dataset is designated **depth\_filt\_mm.**	

The second filter stage applies a gradient-based filter to target non-flood depth measurements caused by objects located under the sensor. When people, animals, or large objects – such as trash, bicycles, vehicles, etc. – pass beneath or are placed under a sensor, there is an immediate increase in depth measured from the ground surface to the height of the object. These non-flood measurements can be distinguished from floods by their profile, given that floods have a gradual onset; this difference in profile allows the use of a filter that assesses the change in depth values between two time-adjacent depth measurements (∆depth/∆time) on a rolling basis. The upper threshold for allowable change in depth over time was set at 254 mm per minute, which is a rate six times greater than the fastest rate of flood onset we have measured thus far in NYC (i.e., during Hurricane Ida). Any data point that exceeds the allowable ∆depth/∆time threshold is filtered, and is represented in the dataset as an empty measurement (i.e., no flood measurement entry will be provided for that time point and it will be a blank cell).

Blips, boxes, and complex noise not captured by the gradient filter are targeted by the third filter stage, which includes three filters applied in the following order: a blip filter, followed by a box filter, followed by another blip filter to clean non-flood data points that the box filter can leave behind. Each filter is described below.

Blips consist of sensor readings that increase for a single measurement then return to the original (or similar) value at the next time point. Blip events are characterized by three consecutive readings with values of *D*1\=*D*, *D*2\=*D*\+∆D, and *D*3 \=*D* ± 0.1∆D, where *D* is any depth measurement ≥ 0, and ∆D is a change in depth greater than 2 mm (i.e., *D*2\-*D*1 \> 2 mm). To recognize this condition, a blip metric for depth measurement *D*2 is calculated following Equation 3\. To apply the filter in real-time, any depth measurement that is at least 2 mm greater than the previous measurement is held in memory and not released to the database or visualization platform until the next measurement (*D*3) arrives, to assess whether the depth measurement is a blip. If the blip metric is less than 0.1, point *D*2 is characterized as a blip and filtered (i.e., the measurement will be empty), otherwise, the measurement remains unmodified.			

Under certain conditions, a low frequency of available data points caused by poor network connectivity could cause a flood event to only be measured in a single data point, mimicking the characteristics of a blip. To reduce the risk of filtering out flood events with few data points, if blips are detected in instances where *D*1 and *D*3 span more than 6 minutes, the filter will query our weather database for reports of precipitation from any rain gauge located in NYC, and will only filter if there has been no reported precipitation in the past hour. Incorporation of tide data to check the possibility of coastal floods is still under development.	

BlipMetric(D2)=|D3-D1|D2-D1  		Eq. 3

Boxes consist of sensor readings that increase immediately and then remain at a constant (or near constant) value for a sustained period of time. The box filter was designed to detect a sharp increase in depth measurement, followed by one or more measurements that remain within 10% of the initial increase in depth. Concretely, given a sequence of depth values of length N, box events are characterized as measurements where *D*1\=0, *D*2\=∆D, and *D*n\=*D*2 ± 0.1∆D for each sequential measurement n in \[3, N\], until some measurement *D*N deviates from the original increase in height (∆D) by more than 10%. To recognize this condition, a box metric for measurement *D*n  is calculated following Equation 4, with values less than 0.1 indicating that *D*n is part of a box. In real-time application, if the conditions of *D*1 and *D*2 are met, then *D*2 is held in memory until the following point *D*3 is received. If *D*3 and subsequent depth measurements (until *D*N) meet the stated condition of a box, then *D*2 through *D*N will be filtered, and will be represented in the dataset as empty measurements (i.e., no flood measurement entries will be provided for those time points and they will be blank cells).To prevent false characterization of floods as boxes, such as mistakenly filtering out the top of a flood given that standing water may have the appearance of a plateau in the flood profile, we restrict the box filter to only filtering non-flood events that start at a depth of zero (i.e., *D*1 \= 0). In cases when poor network connectivity causes sparse data points, the box filter will follow the logic of the blip filter and will only continue to filter points if there was no precipitation within the past hour of a measured data point.

BoxMetric(Dn)=|Dn-D2|D2  		Eq. 4

More complex noise can consist of a noisy series of blips and boxes (and blips on top of boxes) that cannot be easily categorized into the other two categories. These anomalous measurements are more challenging to filter and are not addressed by the filters explicitly, but can be captured partially by a combination of both the blip and box filters. Thus, some pulse chains and other complex noise may remain after the application of the three filter stages. Ongoing research is being conducted to optimize data processing and analysis strategies to recognize and filter out this measurement noise. The dataset that results after the application of the heuristic filters described above is designated **depth\_proc\_mm.**

# Why isn’t the sensor showing a flood?

Ultrasonic sensors need to be perpendicular to and directly above the location that they are measuring. As such, their ability to measure floods is highly dependent on available mounting locations. To deploy FloodNet sensors, we use existing street infrastructure, such as signposts, for installation. We do our best to install sensors over the deepest part of the street, however our reliance on existing infrastructure can limit the locations available for installation, and can potentially result in sensors being installed in locations that are not the lowest point on the street, where floods would first develop. Additionally, if a sensor is installed over a sidewalk, it will not be able to measure a flood developing in the roadbed until the water rises above the height of the curb. 

Streets have variable topography, whereas the sensors measure flood depth at a point location. Therefore the depth measurements captured by the sensors will not reflect the depth at every part of the street. For example, if a flood sensor is installed at a location that is 4 inches higher than the lowest point in the area, the sensor would not measure the depth of floods less than 4 inches deep, and a reading of 10 inches would correspond to 14 inches of depth at the lowest point. The depth offset calculation requires detailed elevation maps and is information that our data scientists are working to compile for our sensor deployments, but is not yet available.
